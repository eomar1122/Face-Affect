## How It Works
Enter your name and a selfie in .jpg, .jpeg, or .png format, and based on your age and associated emotion determined by the Face++ API, receive a personalized music playlist from the Spotify API. The Face++ API distinguishes emotion as a percentage and the associated emotion and percentage will be displayed to the user, as well as their uploaded image and playlist recommendation upon form submission.
